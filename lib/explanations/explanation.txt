Explanation of Changes

Here is a simple breakdown of the updates made to your Flutter project to implement the "Question of the Day" feature and link it to your Profile page.

1. Question of the Day Screen (lib/question_of_the_day.dart)
   - Made it Interactive: Changed the widget from a static page to a `StatefulWidget`. This allows the screen to update when you tap an option or click "Submit".
   - selection Logic: Added code to remember which option you selected (`_selectedOptionIndex`).
   - Submit Logic: 
     - Before you click submit, you can change your answer, and the options just show a selection highlight.
     - After you click submit, the app checks if your answer is right or wrong.
     - If Wrong: The selected option turns Red.
     - If Right: The selected option turns Green (logic prepared).
   - Feedback Section: Added a section that appears only *after* you submit. It shows:
     - "Your Answer" (e.g., Option B)
     - "Correct Answer" (e.g., Paris)
     - A short explanation text.
   - Design: Styled the AppBar to be uppercase and left-aligned, and created custom checkbox-style option buttons to match your screenshot.

2. Profile Page (lib/ProfileScreen/profile_page.dart)
   - Added Navigation: I updated the specific `ProfileList` item for "QUESTION OF THE DAY".
   - Instead of just printing to the console, it now uses `Navigator.push` to open the new `QuestionOfTheDay` screen when tapped.

3. Profile List Button (lib/ProfileScreen/profile_list.dart)
   - Flexible Actions: The `ProfileList` widget was updated earlier to accept an `action` parameter (a function). This allows every button in your list to do something different (like printing text or navigating to a new page) without changing the button code itself.
